Quick Start

- Open this URL in your browser: http://localhost:8000
- If it doesn’t open, start it from the project folder:
  - Open PowerShell in: e:\Data_Scientist_Project\Classifcation Projects\Fault Detection in Manufacturing Processes using Sensor Data
  - Run: python app.py
App Steps

- Click Connect; defaults point to classification.db and Data Dictionary.txt in the project.
- Modeling:
  - Target column: fault_occurred
  - Pick features (use Numeric-only, and toggle Include admin fields if you want time/stage/recipe/etc.)
  - Fast training: leave checked for quicker runs; set Chunk size (e.g., 5,000–10,000).
  - Click Train to train on 500k and evaluate on 200k.
- Review results:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC
  - Confusion Matrix and Feature Importance
  - Download Model button saves the trained artifacts
- Inference:
  - Browse live records (remaining rows) and see predicted_fault and probability per row.
Tips

- If training is slow, try a smaller Chunk size and keep Fast mode enabled.
- To stop and restart:
  - Stop: Ctrl+C in the terminal that’s running the app
  - Restart: python app.py
Dependencies

- Needed: flask, pandas, scikit-learn
- If needed, install: python -m pip install flask pandas scikit-learn
