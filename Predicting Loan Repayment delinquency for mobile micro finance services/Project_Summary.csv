Predicting Loan Repayment delinquency for mobile micro finance services,"Predict customer loan eligibility using telecom recharge behavior, loan history, and usage over 30/90 days. Provide batch predictions and a real-time Flask API + web UI.","Source: SQLite table Telecom_microservices_loan (~2M rows). Missing values; inconsistent date formats; class imbalance; numeric outliers. Quick run used 50k train + 20k eval; remaining rows treated as live. Engineered ratios and date features.","SGDClassifier (logistic loss) with class_weight=balanced inside sklearn Pipeline.","Numeric coercion; median imputation; StandardScaler; OneHotEncoder for pcircle; identifier msisdn dropped for training; engineered features: payback_rate30/90, avg_loan_amt30/90, avg_rech_amt30/90, last_rech_dayofyear, pdate_year/month/dayofweek.","Validation: Accuracy 0.7317; Precision 0.9581; Recall 0.7243; F1 0.8249; ROC-AUC 0.8240. Artifacts: artifacts/loan_eligibility_model.joblib, artifacts/train_metadata.json. APIs: /api/predict, /api/predict-live. UI includes Eligible/Not Eligible filters.","Improves credit targeting, reduces default risk, increases loan conversion; supports real-time scoring and simple deployment."
