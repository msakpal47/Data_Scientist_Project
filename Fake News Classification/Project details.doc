\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b0\fs28 1. Project Overview (Start to End)\par\b0\fs22\par \b Goal: \b0 The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning system capable of automatically classifying news articles as 'Factual' or 'Fake' based on their textual content.\par\par\b Workflow:\b0\par1. \b Data Ingestion:\b0 We read raw data from a SQLite database (classification.db), specifically looking for tables containing text and labels.\par2. \b Data Cleaning & EDA:\b0 The raw data is cleaned to remove rows with missing values, normalize labels (handling 'True'/'False' strings and 0/1 integers), and handle duplicates.\par3. \b Model Training:\b0 We implemented a \b Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch\b0 (probabilistic model) to predict the likelihood of a news piece being fake or real based on word frequencies.\par4. \b Evaluation:\b0 The model is evaluated using Accuracy and Confusion Matrix metrics.\par5. \b Deployment (UI):\b0 A user-friendly web interface was built using \b Streamlit\b0 to allow users to interact with the model, train it on the fly, and classify new text inputs.\par6. \b Monitoring:\b0 Every training run and inference result is logged into a CSV file (Project_Summary.csv) to track performance and business impact over time.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b0\fs28 2. How to Build and Run\par\b0\fs22\par \b Prerequisites:\b0 Python 3.x, pandas, numpy, streamlit, sqlite3, pickle.\par\par\b Steps:\b0\par1. \b Setup Environment:\b0 Ensure all dependencies are installed.\par2. \b Prepare Data:\b0 Place the classification.db file in the project root.\par3. \b Run Application:\b0 Execute the command: streamlit run streamlit_app.py\par4. \b Interact:\b0 Click 'Train Model' to load and train. Click 'Load Saved Model' to use existing artifacts. Enter text and click 'Classify' to test.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b0\fs28 3. Challenges Faced\par\b0\fs22\par \b Data Quality:\b0 Mixed types in labels ('True', 'False', 1, 0) and missing text. Solved by implementing a robust cleaning function.\par\b Class Imbalance:\b0 Real-world data is often skewed. We monitored the Confusion Matrix to ensure we weren't just predicting the majority class.\par\b Text Processing:\b0 Noise in text (punctuation, case). Solved with custom Regex tokenization.\par\b Model Persistence:\b0 Needed to save models without retraining. Solved using Python's pickle module.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b0\fs28 4. Improvements & Key Features\par\b0\fs22\par \b Custom Implementation:\b0 Implemented Naive Bayes from scratch instead of just using scikit-learn, demonstrating deep understanding of probability theory.\par\b Interactive UI:\b0 Built a Streamlit dashboard for non-technical stakeholders.\par\b Experiment Tracking:\b0 Automated logging to CSV acts as a 'lab notebook' for reproducibility.\par\b Error Handling:\b0 Robust checks for missing DBs or models.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b0\fs28 5. Libraries Used & Justification\par\b0\fs22\par \b Streamlit:\b0 For rapid data app creation without HTML/CSS.\par\b Pandas:\b0 Industry standard for tabular data manipulation.\par\b NumPy:\b0 Efficient numerical operations for probability calculations.\par\b SQLite3:\b0 Lightweight, serverless database for standalone projects.\par\b Pickle:\b0 Standard object serialization for saving models.\par
\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\b0\fs28 6. How to Use (User Guide)\par\b0\fs22\par 1. \b Training:\b0 Click 'Train Model' and wait for accuracy metrics.\par2. \b Inference:\b0 Type news text and click 'Classify' to see 'Factual' or 'Fake'.\par3. \b Review:\b0 Check 'Latest Metrics' for model performance details.\par
