Project Name,Problem Identification,Data Issues / EDA,ML Model features,Results,Business Impact
Fault Detection in Manufacturing,"Predict fault occurrence from sensor, TTF and equipment parameters","Large dataset (810,643 rows); class imbalance; missing numeric values; timestamp normalization (time)",RandomForestClassifier; median imputation; numeric sensors only; excludes time/stage/Lot/runnum/recipe/recipe_step; class_weight=balanced; feature importance,Metrics shown in app: Accuracy/Precision/Recall/F1/ROC AUC; confusion matrix; model exported as model_artifacts.pkl,Reduce downtime and scrap; earlier interventions; improved OEE and throughput
Fast Streaming Logistic Regression,"Same objective with faster, chunked training","Chunk-based I/O; per-chunk median imputation; target sanitized to {0,1}; sample-weight balancing",SGDClassifier (logistic); partial_fit over configurable chunks (5k–50k); bootstrap ensures both classes present; progress bars,Streaming evaluation over 200k rows with aggregated metrics and confusion matrix,Rapid iteration for large data; enables faster retraining cycles
Batch Prediction Pipeline,Score remaining live records and persist outputs,Consistent preprocessing with training (median impute; same features),predict_batch.py reads fault_detection_manufacturing; loads model_artifacts.pkl; writes predictions_live.csv,CSV contains predicted_fault and probability (plus time when available),Operational scoring for production monitoring and alerts
Web Dashboard,"Unified UI for data preview, training, evaluation and inference",Data Dictionary display; feature selection (numeric-only/admin toggles); time conversion to numeric,app.py with pinned table fault_detection_manufacturing; 500k/200k split; configurable fast mode and chunk size,"Interactive metrics, confusion matrix, feature ranking, model download; inference on live records",Stakeholder reviews; faster debugging; bridges data science and operations
Artifacts and Reports,Capture reproducible outputs and documentation,Artifacts saved to project root,model_artifacts.pkl; final_report.txt; predictions_live.csv; project_summery.csv,Artifacts updated on training/evaluation; report summarizes features and metrics,Traceability; governance; easier handoff to engineering/operations
