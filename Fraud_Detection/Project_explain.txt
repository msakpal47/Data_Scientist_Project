Fraud Detection App

- Goal: Detect fraudulent bank transactions and provide an interactive web UI for exploration and real‑time predictions.
- Data: Loaded from classification.db; key fields include type, amount, origin/destination balances; high‑cardinality account IDs excluded from modeling.
- Modeling: Preprocessing with imputation and one‑hot encoding for type; trained HistGradientBoostingClassifier; threshold control for precision/recall trade‑off; class imbalance addressed during training.
- UI: Attractive HTML/CSS/JS frontend with filter chips (All/Fraud/Non‑fraud/Flagged), pagination, totals, and CSV export; real‑time prediction form with probability display.
- APIs: /api/transactions for paged table data and filters; /api/predict for single prediction; /api/export for filtered CSV download.
- Files: Backend app.py , frontend index.html , styles style.css , scripts app.js .
- Outcome: UI shows fraud probabilities and labels; table filters speed analyst review; CSV export supports audit and offline analysis.
- Business impact: Reduces potential losses via early detection; improves auditability and analyst efficiency.
Forest Cover Type Prediction

- Goal: Predict forest cover type (classes 1–7) using terrain and soil features.
- Data/EDA: Large dataset with mixed continuous and binary flags; class imbalance across 7 classes; outlier checks and schema validation performed.
- Modeling: RandomForest baseline with engineered features such as hydrology distance, road‑fire distance ratio, elevation–slope interaction, aspect sin/cos; stratified split; artifacts saved.
- Results: Reported accuracy and macro‑F1; tuned to balance performance across imbalanced classes.
- Business impact: Automates vegetation classification, supports ecological research and land‑use planning, and provides consistent, auditable decisions via UI.
