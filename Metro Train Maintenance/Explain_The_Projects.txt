What this project does

- We built a Fault Detection app for Metro Train Maintenance.
- It uses the historical sensor dataset (from classification.db , table fault_detection_manufacturing ) to predict whether a fault will occur ( fault_occurred = 0/1 ).
- The app has a simple web UI (HTML/CSS/JS) + Python API :
  - Train/Retrain model from data
  - Predict fault risk for current sensor readings
  - Shows fault label + probability
Why it matters (business problem)

- Metro operations lose money when trains fail unexpectedly:
  - service delay penalties, refunds, overtime repairs, spare part rush orders
  - safety risk and reputation damage
- This project shifts maintenance from reactive (“repair after breakdown”) to predictive (“fix before failure”).
Business impact (what you tell manager)

- Reduced downtime / service disruption
  - Early fault alerts let teams schedule maintenance during non-peak hours.
- Lower maintenance cost
  - Avoids emergency repairs and reduces unplanned part replacements.
- Better resource planning
  - Maintenance teams can prioritize assets with higher predicted risk.
- Improved safety and compliance
  - Detect risky conditions early → fewer incidents.
- Higher asset availability
  - More trains available for service → better passenger experience and revenue protection.
How it would be used in real life

- Sensors send latest readings → app predicts fault probability .
- If risk is high, create a maintenance ticket (next step integration) and schedule inspection.
- Track outcomes to keep improving model performance over time.
Important note (manager-style risk/limitation)

- The dataset has very few fault cases compared to normal cases (heavy class imbalance), so accuracy alone can look high.
- Real success metric should be: fewer breakdowns, fewer delay minutes, reduced emergency work orders , and acceptable false alarms.
