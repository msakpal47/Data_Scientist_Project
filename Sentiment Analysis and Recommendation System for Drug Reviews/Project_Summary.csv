"Sentiment Analysis and Recommendation System for Drug Reviews","Use NLP to analyze user drug reviews and predict sentiment; support drug recommendations; provide batch training/prediction and a real-time Flask API + web UI.","Source: SQLite table drug_reviews_sentiment_analysis (161,297 rows). Some reviews contain HTML/escape characters; potential duplicates; null reviews dropped. Brief suggests train 112,908, eval 32,259, live 16,130; implementation used stratified 80/20 split for quick run.","sklearn Pipeline: TfidfVectorizer(max_features=50000, ngram_range=(1,2)) + LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000).
