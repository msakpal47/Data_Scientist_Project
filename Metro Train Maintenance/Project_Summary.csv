"Metro Train Maintenance – Fault Detection Web App","Predict whether a fault will occur from metro train/manufacturing sensor signals and provide a simple web app for training + real-time prediction.","SQLite dataset (fault_detection_manufacturing); very strong class imbalance (fault_occurred: 0=810,517 vs 1=126); numeric sensor ranges vary; missing/invalid values handled; negative class subsampled for training to include both classes.","LogisticRegression (final) with class_weight=balanced; trained on all positives + random sample of negatives; probability output enabled.","Numeric coercion; median imputation for missing values; StandardScaler; consistent feature schema saved; model saved as joblib for reuse in API inference.","Flask API + HTML/CSS/JS UI: Train/Retrain button, auto-filled feature form (median defaults), Predict button returns fault label + probability; model + schema persisted in /models; verified endpoints (/api/train, /api/predict).","Enables early fault detection and proactive maintenance planning; reduces unexpected breakdowns and service disruption; improves safety and maintenance efficiency by prioritizing high-risk conditions."
